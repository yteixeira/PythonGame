# PythonGame

I have taken the project of the python game that was the first lesson in python and I updated with everything that we learned throughout the course. So I have added classes, function, loops, arrays, etc.

The game is played in a console window that was tested in pycharm.


The goal of the game is to move the character ("X") to the goal ("O") while avoiding the enemies ("E"). You can move the character by typing "up", "down", "left" or "right". You can end the game by typing "end".
